                            I started as a Network Engineering Student. However, I was more curious and eager to learn about Artificial Intelligence. So, I ended up doing my graduation internship in Novel-Ti (a Tunisian startup) and discovering more about AI and Computer Vision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In September 2018, I started working full-time at Novel-Ti as an R&D Engineer where I helped building AI and Computer Vision solutions that solve real world problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In August 2021, I decided to start my first experience abroad. My first role was a Machine Learning and IT consultant at Aigometri AB.
                            <br>
                            I assisted my colleagues with working on an internal project where I took care of the AI & Computer Vision part and helped in building a test platform for the project.
                            <br>
                            I also worked as a Software Engineer Consultant for one of the biggest fintech companies in Europe. My role as consultant was about maintaining integrations with third party systems and building automations to improve the efficiency and performance of the different teams.
                        </p>
                            May 2022 was the beginning of my third work experience. I was offered a Data Engineer role at Klarna. Since then, I discovered my passion about Data; my role there covers data-modeling, designing and building ETL pipelines and data-warehousing.
